Are you also annoyed by having to laboriously calculate the calorie value of a snack or meal? This is a script for Google Sheets that calculates a suitable kcal number for the description of a dish or meal. It implements a new function CALORIES() that takes a written description of a meal as input and returns the estimated kcal value by asking OpenAI's ChatGPT for it. Since ChatGPT accepts multilingual input, this script does too.

```=CALORIES("One Croissant and a Caf√© au lait.")``` returns ```310```

ChatGPT may return varying values for the same prompt. However, it still seems to be a good estimation of what the reality might be.

## How To Use
